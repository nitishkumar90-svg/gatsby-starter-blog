What are you up to this weekend? This is the start of Toby’s birthday month, which he has planned with great fanfare. We are kicking it off with a piñata this weekend! Hope you have a good one, and here are a few links from around the web…

<br/>

I am LOVING this **funny, honest audiobook**.

<br/>

How yummy does **this sandwich look?**

<br/>

**Is it a vaccine side effect or have you just been alive for 40 years?** Hahaha.

<br/>

**Brilliant.**

<br/>

A sexy springtime **pick-me-up.**

<br/>

Can you see **this optical illusion?**

<br/>

**Shortbread**, oh, how I love thee.

<br/>

**A great everyday shirt.**

<br/>

“I’m not languishing, **I’m dormant.”**

<br/>

Why is perimenopause still a mystery? (New York Times)

<br/>

“Ted Lasso awakened lots of things in me.”

<br/>

Plus two reader comments:

<br/>

Says Jill on three women share their later-in-life accomplishments: “In 12 days I will graduate with my bachelor’s degree at the age of 54! That first sip of champagne that I take while watching my virtual graduation will be so so so sweet and delightful! I am so damn proud of myself! I DID IT!!”

<br/>

Says Johanna on three women share their later-in-life accomplishments: “So many of the role models and stories I grew up carried an implicit message that ‘happily-ever-after’ should be achieved by around 28 (typically with marriage and a baby). It’s so limiting and a bit depressing! It’s inspiring to see examples of people continuing to lead rich, multi-layered lives full of growth and exploration. May we all be neither late bloomers nor early bloomers, but perennials.”
