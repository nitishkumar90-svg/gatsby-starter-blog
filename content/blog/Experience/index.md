**Meet my go-to side salad recipe.** I hope it becomes yours, too. This simple salad features fresh arugula and the world’s easiest homemade balsamic salad dressing.

<br/>

**This salad truly could not be more easy to make.** In fact, it’s so easy that I’ve hesitated to share it with you. It’s hardly a recipe, but one that I make constantly. It’s about time that I bring this method to your attention, you say?

<br/>

**Side salads should be easy to prepare**, and this one is so delicious that it doesn’t taste like an afterthought. It goes with just about everything—think Italian entrées like lasagna, sandwiches, scrambled eggs, and even holiday meals.

<br/>

**You can use this salad formula with any type of leafy green**, but arugula is my favorite. You’ll eat more healthy greens if you keep this recipe in your back pocket. Here we go!
