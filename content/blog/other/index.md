For better or worse, I’m someone who adores variety, and so it’s no surprise that Mill Run Golf Club is one of my favourite Ontario golf experiences around. 

<br/>

Located in the rolling hills of Uxbridge Township, Mill Run currently has a 27 hole Championship Course, as well a 18 hole Highland Course to call their own. This means that they have got a little something for golfers of all skill levels and also different schedules. 

<br/>

Some folks might want to play all three unique 9 whole courses that comprise the 27 hole Championship Course in one fell swoop. Another person may want to whip through the Highland Course, and perhaps another might just want to sneak in nine holes after work. 

<br/>

With golf clubs that have one course, you simply don’t have this kind of flexibility, so Mill Run suits my personality and temperament perfectly. 

<br/>

In this article, I’ll run through pertinent information about the course, relay my personal experience where applicable, as well as addressing any frequently asked questions about Mill Run Golf Club to ensure that after you finish reading this, you’ll know whether Mill Run is for you!

<br/>

##A Brief History of Mill Run Golf Club 

<br/>

Firstly, it should be noted that the course was designed by Rene Mulyaert, who is very well known Ontario golf architect. In fact, he was also the brainpower behind another Ontario golf course that I reviewed recently, St. Andrew’s Valley. 

<br/>

I appreciated how challenging St. Andrew’s Valley was, but at the end of the day, I do indeed prefer Mill Run, and largely because of that aforementioned variety. It’s priceless to me that there are so many different quality options to improve your game and appreciate the sport at Mill Run. 

<br/>

Mill Run is a semi-private course, meaning that the membership is the backbone of what goes on there. In fact, the way that they approach leagues and tournaments breeds a genuine sense of community. I get into more of that in the FAQ section near the bottom. 

<br/>

It’s clear that they’re constantly trying to improve, which can be exemplified by the addition of “The Grind,” the nine hole course built in 2007 that differentiated Mill Run since they now have 27 championship holes.

As I mentioned before, they have three separate nine hole championship courses that can be played in combination - “Wheel,” “Grist,” and “Grind.” Plus, they have their 18 hole Highland course, which is one of the top short golf courses in Ontario. The four ways Mill Run is most commonly played is as follows. 

<br/>

Wheel-Grind is 18 holes with a par of 72, and coming in at 6633 yards.

<br/>

<br/>
