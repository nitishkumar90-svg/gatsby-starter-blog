              <p className="blog-description">Hi I'm Nitish Kumar, design thinking full-stack JavaScript developer with a passion for motion design. I'm currently living in Brampton, Canada, but originally from India. I'm an absolute geek and love geeking out on all things JavaScript.
              </p><p>
                First fell in love with web design 7 years ago simply because it made my Photoshop artwork come alive. Since then I have been hooked. Although my focus for now is heavily in both frontend and backend web development. My favorite development stack at the moment is React, UIkit, Node, Firebase.
              </p><p>
                Values I hold high are loyalty, reliability, authenticity and helping other achieve their success. Which is why I see projects through to the end and why I believe in not only creating beautiful software but also reliable and reflect the client's brand and that is easy to use so that it does not distract the a user experience
              </p><p>
                Whether itâ€™s creating servers in Node, connecting to Firebase databases or designing unique user experiences per device whilst still maintaining a consistent brand experience I will bring your ideas to life.</p>
